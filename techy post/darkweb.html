        <h1>THE DARK WEB</h1>
        <div class="img"> <img src="https://www.dsbls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AdobeStock_209412221-scaled.jpeg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="information">

            <p>In this article, we will unpack the complexities of the dark web. Get ready for a journey into the depths of these hidden corners of the internet.</p>

                <p>The Surface Web refers to publicly accessible websites indexed by search engines like social media platforms online stores etc, while the Deep Web encompasses non-indexed content like private databases and password-protected sites. The dark web encompasses encrypted websites and websites lacking identifiable IP addresses which hide their existence. Users access it through encrypted software to safeguard their identities</p>
                
                <p>The dark web employs technologies like Onion Routing to safeguard user anonymity and privacy. This involves encrypting data with multiple layers, with the original message at the innermost layer. Tor, also known as The Onion Router, utilizes Onion Routing, enabling access to the dark web through its browser. Internet traffic in Tor is routed through a chain of nodes, making it challenging to trace the origin of the connection. Each node knows only the previous node in the network, adding layers of encryption like an onion. Websites on the dark web utilize .onion domains, which can only be accessed through the Tor Browser. These domains consist of randomly generated alphanumeric strings followed by “.onion”.</p>
                
                <p>The dark web operates on a multi-layered structure. The first layer consists of websites and services accessible through the Tor network, ranging from benign platforms to illicit marketplaces. The second layer encompasses hidden services that are not indexed by search engines and require direct links for access, emphasizing privacy and encrypted communication. The existence of a third layer, known as the “Marianas Web” or “Level 8,” is a subject of speculation and lacks verifiable evidence.</p>
                
                <p>The dark web is notorious for its illegal activities, including the sale of stolen data and counterfeit products like fake passports and driver’s licenses. It offers a platform for trading personal information, credit card details, and fake identification documents. Firearms, ranging from guns to rocket launchers, can be obtained on dark web marketplaces. It serves as a hub for drug trade, facilitating the sale of narcotics and prescription medications. Most of this stuff isn’t even for sale and is just out there. The dark web also hosts websites that expose sensitive information about politicians and ordinary individuals. Disturbingly, hitmen services are available for shockingly low prices. Furthermore, there are even markets selling human organs. This is only a small look into the dark web and the lack of rules here allows anything to exist the deeper you go the scarier things you’ll find. To maintain anonymity on the dark web, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are used for purchases instead of traceable credit cards due to their high level of privacy and difficulty to trace.</p>
                
                <p>The Silk Road, a prominent platform on the dark web, was launched in 2011 and facilitated the illegal buying and selling of drugs, guns, and counterfeit cash. Despite being taken down by the FBI in 2013, it managed to generate 187 billion dollars. The dark web is not as extensive as often believed, with larger services frequently being targeted by law enforcement. However, new platforms quickly emerge to fill the void, as seen with the introduction of Silk Road 2.0 after the original Silk Road’s takedown.</p>
                
                <p>The dark web also serves legitimate purposes such as providing a platform where people can communicate anonymously, express themselves, and share information, without worrying about being monitored or facing consequences. This allows individuals to access uncensored information, visit blocked websites, and express themselves freely without restriction. It creates an environment where privacy, freedom of expression and transparency are valued and protected. However, visiting the dark web comes with risks such as malware, fraud, identity theft, and disturbing features. In order to remain safe, individuals must implement secure systems, implement strong security measures, verify websites and vendors, implement OpSec (operational security), avoid to engage in illegal activities, and be informed of potential threats</p>
                
                <p>In my Opinion the dark web’s perception depends on personal interpretation and openness. It doesn’t have to be a negative place; its scariness arises when one actively seeks out disturbing content. The dark web provides privacy and anonymity, whether used for positive or negative purposes depends on the user. It offers a platform for free speech and expression, benefiting those in oppressive regimes. However, it also hosts criminal activities, emphasizing the need to combat illegal behavior. By approaching the dark web cautiously and adhering to legality and morality, individuals can navigate it to protect privacy while minimizing harm.</p>
